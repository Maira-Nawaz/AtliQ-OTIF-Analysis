### Problem Statement:

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India, with operations in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. With plans to expand to more metro and Tier-1 cities, the company faced a critical issue â€” the loss of key customers due to poor delivery service. Specifically, some essential products were frequently not delivered on time or not delivered in full, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and non-renewal of annual contracts.

To tackle this, the Supply Chain Analytics team was tasked with implementing a tracking system to monitor service levels on a daily basis for every customer. The goal was to measure and improve:

1. OT% (On-Time Delivery Percentage)

2. IF% (In-Full Delivery Percentage)

3. OTIF% (On-Time In-Full Delivery Percentage)


## Project Objectives
- Identify delivery performance gaps across cities and customers.

- Track trends and service KPIs (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) over time.

- Compare performance against target benchmarks.

- Enable proactive action to resolve delivery issues before they escalate.

##  Tools & Features
This analysis was conducted using Power BI, offering interactive dashboards with:

- City-level breakdowns (Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara)

- Product-level performance (Line Fill Rate, Volume Fill Rate)

- Customer-wise OTIF scoring

- Average delivery delay trends

- Visual comparison vs target thresholds


## Key Insights (from dashboard)
The overall OTIF performance averaged 29%, highlighting room for improvement.

Some customers consistently received late or incomplete deliveries.

The average delivery delay was 1.69 days beyond the promised date.

Cities like Ahmedabad showed relatively better service rates compared to others.
